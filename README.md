# Event Dashboard App

## Description

The Event Dashboard App is a React-based application where you can manage and display events. 
Developed as part of a course with Winc Academy, this project combines everything learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (both basics and advanced) into a complete, functional event management app. The app allows users to:

- Display a list of events
- Add, edit, and delete events
- View a detailed page for each event

This app gives you flexibility in using React tools like `useReducer`, `Context`, or component composition to build and manage application state. 
While the project includes ChakraUI for styling and design consistency, youâ€™re also free to customize the look with your own CSS or custom components.

The project is designed as a portfolio-ready app to showcase my proficiency in React and frontend development.
